  <p>SAFARI NJEMA aims at supporting a process of innovation and redesign of the current system of informal mobility providing data and information which could feed a more efficient organisation to it. In fact: if the current informal mobility solutions will not be able to develop a more structured business and more efficient and safer service model, it is very likely that they will not be able survive in the face of more formal mobility policies supported by national projects or international funds, at the same time, the possible elimination of informal mobility would come at a high social cost for more fragile sectors of the population, or for spatially marginal areas, with high risks of additional socio-spatial marginalisation.</p>
