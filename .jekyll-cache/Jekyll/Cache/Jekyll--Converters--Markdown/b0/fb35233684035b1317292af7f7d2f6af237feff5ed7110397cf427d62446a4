I"ý<p>Automatic Road Pavement Detection consists in the development of a machine learning pipeline aimed at the classification of road surfaces based on the colour of the pavement and its particular location.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Development of a data transformation scheme allowing for the deployment of machine learning algorithms.</li>
    <li>Construction, training, and quality and robustness assessment of a pool of different techniques.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The output is a set of algorithmic techniques tuned to solve the problem. Such algorithms are developed relying on open-source and free software to ensure that they can be used by the community at large.</p>
