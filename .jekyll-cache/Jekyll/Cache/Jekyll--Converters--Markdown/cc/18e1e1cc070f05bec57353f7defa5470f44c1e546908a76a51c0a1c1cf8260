  <p>Approximately 80% of mobility in big african cities is based on para-transit transportation systems: near all families do not own private cars, but at the same time reliable and affordable public transportation systems are missing. Para-transit, often insecure and inefficient, is usually preferred to formal transportation. The lack of adequate mobility systems affects economic development in african cities and the populationâ€™s welfare.
Through analysis and production of new data, starting from information gathered from the usage of mobile connectivity, <em>Safari Njema</em> explores bottom-up and place-based solutions replicable and alternate to formal models.</p>
