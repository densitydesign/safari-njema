I"æ<p>Automatic Road Pavement Detection consists in the development of a machine learning pipeline aimed at the classification of road surfaces based on the colour of the pavement and its particular location.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Development of a data transformation scheme allowing for the deployment of machine learning algorithms.</li>
    <li>Construction, training, and quality and robustness assessment of a pool of different techniques.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The output is a set of algorithmic techniques tuned to solve the problem. Such algorithms are developed relying on open-source and free software to ensure that they can be used by the community at large.</p>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity 1</h3>
<p>Preprocessing of the data. Data are to be converted into a usable format. Conversion ought to guarantee the integrity of the intermediate output. It is a crucial part of the project, as it defines the boundary of applicability of the methodology.</p>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity 2</h3>
<p>Construction of the algorithms. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyse processed data. According to the best practices of machine learning, a pool of techniques is selected in a first stage. Quality is then assessed by running a benchmark test.</p>
