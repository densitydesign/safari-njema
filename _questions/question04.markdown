Automatic Road Pavement Detection consists in the development of a machine learning pipeline aimed at the classification of road surfaces based on the colour of the pavement and its particular location.

## Objectives
> 1. Development of a data transformation scheme allowing for the deployment of machine learning algorithms.
2. Construction, training, and quality and robustness assessment of a pool of different techniques.

The output is a set of algorithmic techniques tuned to solve the problem. Such algorithms are developed relying on open-source and free software to ensure that they can be used by the community at large.

## Activities

### Activity 1
Preprocessing of the data. Data are to be converted into a usable format. Conversion ought to guarantee the integrity of the intermediate output. It is a crucial part of the project, as it defines the boundary of applicability of the methodology.

### Activity 2
Construction of the algorithms. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyse processed data. According to the best practices of machine learning, a pool of techniques is selected in a first stage. Quality is then assessed by running a benchmark test.
