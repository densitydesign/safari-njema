Automatic Road Pavement Detection consists in the development of a machine learning pipeline aimed at the classification of road surfaces based on the colour of the pavement and its particular location.

## Objectives
> 1. Development of a data transformation scheme allowing for the deployment of machine learning algorithms.
2. Construction, training, and quality and robustness assessment of a pool of different techniques.

The output is a set of algorithmic techniques tuned to solve the problem. Such algorithms are developed relying on open-source and free software to ensure that they can be used by the community at large.
