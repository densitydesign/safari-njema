Automatic Road Pavement Detection consists in the development of a machine learning pipeline aimed at the classification of road surfaces based on the colour of the pavement and its particular location.

## Objectives
1. Understanding of features characterising formal and paratransit mobility
2. Identification of key stakeholders in formal and paratransit mobility arena and identification of their needs
3. Identification of key performance dimensions of formal and paratransit mobility

## Activities

### Activity 1
Preprocessing of the data. Data are to be converted into a usable format. Conversion ought to guarantee the integrity of the intermediate output. It is a crucial part of the project, as it defines the boundary of applicability of the methodology.

### Activity 2
Construction of the algorithms. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyse processed data. According to the best practices of machine learning, a pool of techniques is selected in a first stage. Quality is then assessed by running a benchmark test.
