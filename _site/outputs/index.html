        <div id="methodology" class="outputs"><h1 class="page-heading">Results</h1><div class="methodology--content"><p>Approximately 80% of mobility in big African cities is based on <em>paratransit</em> transportation systems: since almost any family owns private cars and since reliable and affordable public transportation systems are missing, collective paratransit solutions are usually preferred to formal transportation. The lack of adequate, safe and accessible mobility systems affects economic development in African cities and the population’s welfare, contributing to the phenomenon of transport poverty. Through analysis and production of new data, starting from information gathered from the usage of mobile connectivity, the Safari Njema project explores bottom-up and place-based mobility solutions, which are replicable and complementary to formal mobility models.</p>

          <p>As a first experiment, a small map-athon was organized in Maputo within the research team to have a first hand experience of the mobility systems in the city. For the Mobility Week organized in September, members of the research teams explored the city with formal and para-transit transportations systems through the whole week, gathering data both from the platforms provided by the research partners, and from a simple web app developed for this purpose.

          <p>In the mobility setting of Maputo area, measuring mobility through GPS data can have a two side effect. On one side, local transport authorities can use the analysis results to better map and optimize the offer of public transport system. On the other side, citizens can also access to more informative description of the public transport system. Builting Origin Destination Matrices is a first step towards the measurement and the understanding of the phenomenon. Objectives...</p>

          <p>Designing an efficient mobility system affects not only the transportation service but has also consequences in terms of economic growth and social integration, since efficient transportation service exacerbates poverty and inequality. This motivates the development of this specific study within SAFARI project, concerned with the management of transportation systems characterized by both formal and paratransit forms of mobility in the particular context of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where Maputo (Mozambique) has been selected as pilot...</p>

          <p>This research is a preliminary step for an upcoming project. Its focus is to describe the state of the art of Informal Transport Mapping in Sub-Saharan Africa. Informal Transports are defined, by literature, as: “Paratransit-type services provided without official sanction.” (R. Cervero, A. Golub, Informal Transport: A global perspective) In most of the sub-Saharan African cities, where this kind of service exists, there isn’t an official mapping of the buses lines and stops. However, there...</p>
