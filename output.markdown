Approximately 80% of mobility in big African cities is based on *paratransit* transportation systems: since almost any family owns private cars and since reliable and affordable public transportation systems are missing, collective paratransit solutions are usually preferred to formal transportation. The lack of adequate, safe and accessible mobility systems affects economic development in African cities and the populationâ€™s welfare, contributing to the phenomenon of transport poverty. Through analysis and production of new data, starting from information gathered from the usage of mobile connectivity, the Safari Njema project explores bottom-up and place-based mobility solutions, which are replicable and complementary to formal mobility models.
