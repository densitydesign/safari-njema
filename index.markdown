> Approximately 80% of mobility in big african cities is based on *para-transit transportation systems*: near all families do not own private cars, but at the same time reliable and affordable public transportation systems are missing. Para-transit, often insecure and inefficient, is usually preferred to formal transportation. The lack of adequate mobility systems affects economic development in african cities and the population's welfare.
Through analysis and production of new data, starting from information gathered from the usage of mobile connectivity, *Safari Njema* explores bottom-up and place-based solutions replicable and alternate to formal models.
