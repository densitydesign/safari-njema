> Safari Njema -“nice trip” in Swahili language- is a pilot interdisciplinary project that proposes an innovative methodology to study and reduce “transport poverty”, supporting bottom-up and ordinary practices through the use of big data. The project is managed by a highly interdisciplinary team, composed by scholars and researchers in the field of mathematics and statistics, urban studies, policy design and co-design, informational engineering and management engineering. The researchers collaborate on a permanent basis under the Data@ter transdisciplinary nucleum at Politecnico di Milano.
