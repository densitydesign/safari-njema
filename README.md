# Safari Njema - Polisocial Award 2018

To create a new research insight on the main page, add a new file called `question0X.markdown` in the `_question` folder, where X is the number consequential to the other research insights.

Meta tags (between the ---):
- number: from 1 to n, following the latest page. Each research insight comes after the other.
- layout: visualization or post. If a visualization, add a `visualization0X.html` with the image of your visualization(s), where X is the number of the research insight. If a post, it will display only text.
- title: Title of your research insight.
- department: The Department or Entity that coordinated the research effort.
- authors: Names of the authors that worked on the research effort.

This is the template:
